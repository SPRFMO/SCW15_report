## Day 1 summary {.unnumbered}

### Participants and Setup

-   The workshop included both in-person and online participation, with
    representatives from Peru, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and the
    Netherlands, among others.

-   The agenda was described as ambitious, with a focus on hands-on
    technical work, including software installation and repository
    access.

### Technical Infrastructure & Workflow

-   Two main GitHub repositories are central: FLjjm (for building FLR
    objects and running JJM inside the MP) and jjmMSE (the main
    development site for the MSE work).

-   The workflow follows the DAF (Data, Analysis, Framework) system,
    with clear steps for data preparation, OEM (Operating Model)
    conditioning, and performance analysis.

-   Emphasis was placed on forking repositories and using branches for
    collaborative work, with a preference for merging at the end of the
    week.

-   Docker was suggested as a potential solution for ensuring consistent
    environments across operating systems and participants, though not
    yet implemented.

### Modeling and Simulation

-   The group is working with both single-stock and two-stock
    hypotheses, including a two-stock model with future-applied
    connectivity based on movement matrices.

-   Robustness scenarios are being explored, including cyclic
    environmental changes and their impacts on productivity.

-   The group discussed the use of ".q" files for efficient storage and
    handling of large simulation outputs.

### Key Scientific Discussions

-   The calculation and interpretation of MSY (Maximum Sustainable
    Yield) and *F~MSY~* were debated, with concerns about the realism of
    current methods in JJM.

-   It was agreed that the 10-year average of MSY reference points would
    be used for performance evaluation, to avoid short-term volatility.

-   Selectivity patterns and their impact on projections were a major
    topic. The group considered transitioning from terminal year
    selectivity to long-term averages over a five-year period to avoid
    unrealistic jumps in catch projections.

-   There was consensus that the main focus should be on long-term
    performance of management procedures, but short- and mid-term
    results are also important for managers.

### Environmental and Biological Scenarios

-   The workshop addressed the need to model environmental variability,
    particularly El Niño events, and their impact on stock productivity,
    weight-at-age, and selectivity.

-   Literature-informed scenarios were presented, with parameters for
    changes in mortality, recruitment, and spatial distribution.

-   Regional differences (e.g., between far north and south stocks) and
    their implications for catchability and biological responses were
    discussed.

### Action Items and Next Steps

-   Participants will review and potentially refine the environmental
    scenarios, with a focus on realism and literature support.

-   Further work is planned on selectivity transitions and the technical
    implementation of gradual changes.

-   The group will continue to test and validate the workflow, with an
    emphasis on reproducibility and collaborative code development.

## Day 2 {.unnumbered}

### Opening

-   The workshop began with participant introductions, including new
    attendees such as Robert Robinson.

-   Jim Ianelli welcomed participants, provided a recap of the previous
    day, and referenced a summary posted in the Teams channel for
    review.

### Review of Previous Work and Agenda

-   The agenda was described as ambitious, with a focus on technical
    aspects of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).

-   Discussion included the effects of El Niño on recruitment and catch
    distribution, referencing an unsent summary email and a report on
    the topic.

### Technical Discussions

#### a. Effects of El Niño and Distribution Shifts

-   Jim presented an analysis of catch distribution changes between
    coastal and offshore fleets, proposing a 15% average offshore drop
    (60% decline in Q for offshore fleet) and an 11% increase for
    coastal zones.

-   Participants debated the appropriateness of using long-term versus
    short-term averages and the need for smoothing changes rather than
    step changes.

-   It was agreed that the effect should be applied to both availability
    and catchability in simulations, with implications for the acoustic
    survey indices.

#### b. Selectivity and Projection Periods

-   The group discussed the transition from recent selectivity estimates
    to long-term means, with concerns about artifacts from using 10-year
    averages.

-   Consensus moved toward using a representative period (2000--2010)
    for selectivity, avoiding recent years with anomalously high
    selection for older fish.

-   The need for a smooth transition in selectivity assumptions for
    projections was emphasized.

#### c. Recruitment Regimes and Projections

-   Analysis of recruitment means for projections considered the El Niño
    effect, with a proposed 23--30% bump up in recruitment for recent
    years.

-   Debate ensued on which years to include for calculating means, with
    a focus on data consistency from 1991 onward.

-   The group discussed the potential for regime shifts and the
    implications for robustness testing in MSE.

#### d. Model Implementation and Coding Practices

-   Demonstrations were given on the use of R and package structures for
    running MSE simulations, including best practices for project setup
    and function sourcing.

-   The importance of consistent selectivity and Q parameter
    normalization across projections and indices was highlighted.

### Decisions and Action Items

-   Adopt 2000--2010 as the reference period for selectivity in
    projections, with a smooth transition from current conditions.

-   Apply a 23--30% recruitment increase for projections reflecting
    recent El Niño effects, with final years to be confirmed.

-   Ensure normalization of selectivity and Q parameters is consistent
    across all indices and projections.

-   Continue refining the codebase, documenting changes, and sharing
    updates among the technical team.

### Other Business and Closing

-   Participants shared experiences with data handling, model setup, and
    coding challenges.

-   The workshop included informal discussions and technical
    clarifications.

-   The session concluded with plans to continue reviewing model outputs
    and performance indicators, and to reconvene as needed for further
    technical work.

## Day 3 {.unnumbered}

### Review of Technical Issues and Model Adjustments

-   Discussion focused on the technical aspects of Management Strategy
    Evaluation (MSE) for jack mackerel.

-   Participants examined the function and configuration of sliding
    buffers, control rules, and the impact of selectivity changes.

-   The group reviewed how indices (e.g., CPUE, acoustics) are
    incorporated, including the use of averages over multiple years and
    weighting schemes for recent data.

-   There was debate on the variance and correlation structure in
    observation models, and how these affect simulation results.

### Timing and Implementation of Management Procedures (MPs)

-   The workflow and timing for implementing MPs were clarified:

    -   Data from 2026 would be used for advice in 2027.

    -   The Scientific Committee (SC) would run the MP, with the
        Commission making final decisions.

    -   Discussion on the need for preliminary versus finalized data and
        the implications for observation error.

-   The importance of using the most recent data versus the stability of
    multi-year averages was highlighted.

### Treatment of Effort Creep and Index Standardization

-   Participants agreed that simulating effort creep in future
    projections is not necessary for the base case, but could be a
    robustness test.

-   The importance of correcting historical indices for effort creep was
    emphasized, while future indices are assumed to be unbiased.

-   There was consensus that the standardized or corrected index should
    be used for both simulation and real-world application.

### Selection and Tuning of Management Procedures

-   Multiple MPs were tested, each tuned to a 60% probability of meeting
    the Kobe green zone.

-   The group compared different buffer widths and TAC change limits,
    analyzing their effects on catch variability and performance
    metrics.

-   Discussion included the need for clear documentation of
    specifications and the importance of presenting a set of MPs with
    distinct trade-offs to the Commission, rather than recommending a
    single option.

### Performance Metrics and Projections

-   The team reviewed performance across near-term, medium-term, and
    long-term projections.

-   Boxplots and other visualizations were used to compare MPs, focusing
    on catch variability, probability of stock being in the green zone,
    and interannual TAC changes.

-   Concerns were raised about downward trends in some simulations and
    the need for additional performance statistics (e.g., probability of
    stock crash).

### Next Steps and Action Items

-   Agreement to refine the OM projections and finalize Annex
    documentation on selectivity and other specifications.

-   Plan to continue testing and tuning MPs, with further analysis of
    performance metrics.

-   The SC will present a set of MPs to the Commission, along with the
    status quo as a fallback.

-   Lunch arrangements and informal discussions concluded the session.

## Day 4 {.unnumbered}

### Key Activities and Discussions

-   Model Runs and Debugging:

    -   Overnight and morning runs were conducted to examine the
        acoustics index using legacy targets and buffers.

    -   A significant focus was on debugging the generation of CPUE v3
        for 2024 and 2025, investigating unexpected jumps in predicted
        values.

    -   Alternative normalization methods for CPUE were tested,
        following recommendations to improve stability.

-   Analysis of Index Jumps:

    -   The team identified that the jump in the index from 2024 to 2025
        was primarily driven by increases in vulnerable biomass and
        changes in mean weight at age, rather than selectivity changes
        alone.

    -   Weighted age calculations and their implications for projections
        were reviewed in detail, including the use of three-year means
        and the impact of preliminary data from 2024.

-   Code Review and Live Demonstration:

    -   Live coding sessions were held to demonstrate how to adjust the
        OM to exclude problematic years (e.g.,
        dropping 2024 and extending from 2023).

    -   Smoothing techniques for selectivity and weights at age were
        discussed and implemented to reduce artificial jumps in
        projections.

-   Uncertainty and Robustness:

    -   The group discussed the treatment of process error, residual
        variability, and autocorrelation in indices.

    -   Empirical approaches to setting CVs for indices were compared
        with default values, and the impact on future projections was
        considered.

-   Action Items and Next Steps:

    -   Further testing of the OM with adjusted years and smoothing is
        to be completed, with outputs to be pushed under new filenames
        to avoid disrupting ongoing work.

    -   Continued analysis of the causes of high catches in test runs
        and further parameter tuning were assigned.

    -   The group agreed to revisit and possibly refine the approach to
        handling preliminary data and smoothing in both indices and
        weights at age.

### Notable Outcomes

-   Consensus that both selectivity and mean weight at age contribute to
    observed index jumps, with smoothing and exclusion of problematic
    years being viable mitigation strategies.

-   Agreement to document and communicate technical progress to the
    broader group, while maintaining a focus on robust, transparent
    modeling practices.

## Day 5 {.unnumbered}

### Model Runs and Technical Issues

-   The group reviewed progress on running various management procedures
    (MPs), focusing on the acoustic and CPUE indices. Issues with FL
    libraries and model reproducibility were discussed, with fixes
    applied to ensure models ran as expected.

-   Robustness tests were conducted, particularly comparing the
    performance of different indices (acoustic, CPUE3, CPUE6, 3.6). The
    need to clarify how "shortcut" procedures treat stocks was debated,
    especially regarding biomass tracking and catch splits.

-   The group noted that tuning parameters (e.g., width, slope ratio)
    and their impact on model performance remain a challenge, especially
    when standardizing across indices.

### Interpretation and Presentation of Results

-   There was significant discussion about interpreting outputs,
    particularly when catch trends did not align with biomass trends.
    Concerns were raised about the credibility of certain indices and
    the need for clearer communication of model behavior.

-   The importance of visualizing trade-offs and the response of TAC to
    indices was emphasized, with ongoing efforts to develop summary
    figures for inclusion in reports.

### Workflows, Code, and Collaboration

-   Participants shared experiences with the codebase, noting progress
    in understanding and modifying functions, but also highlighting the
    need for further documentation and standardization.

-   The group agreed on the value of reproducibility and transparency,
    with suggestions to document daily progress and maintain clear
    records for future reference.

### Planning and Next Steps

-   The group recognized that while technical progress was made, the
    process is ongoing. There was consensus on the need for another
    technical workshop (ideally in person) to continue development and
    evaluation of MPs.

-   The timeline for delivering a report to the Scientific Committee
    (SC) and Commission was discussed, with acknowledgment that final
    recommendations are not yet possible. Instead, the report will focus
    on documenting progress, challenges, and a proposed work plan for
    the coming year.

-   Concerns about funding, continuity (especially regarding software
    and contracts), and the need for member commitment to ongoing tool
    development were raised.

### Recommendations and Reflections

-   The group agreed to recommend continued development and evaluation
    of MPs, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and clear
    communication to managers.

-   It was noted that, if a new MP is not ready for 2026, the existing
    method (Annex K) will remain in use.

-   There was broad recognition of the complexity and time required for
    this process, and appreciation for the collaborative progress made
    during the workshop.
