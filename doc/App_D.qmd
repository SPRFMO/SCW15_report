Dr. Ana Parma, along with Qi Lee reviewed the jmMSE framework and its
application to evaluating candidate management procedures (CMPs) for
jack mackerel. Their comments provide both a validation of the current
approach and targeted suggestions for improvement.

### General Observations on the jmMSE Tool

The jmMSE package offers a comprehensive and flexible platform for
conducting Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). It includes:

-   A reference set of Operating Models conditioned to historical data
    using MCMC.\
-   A suite of visualization tools and performance metrics for comparing
    CMPs.\
-   An efficient tuning algorithm that adjusts user-selected MP
    parameters to achieve a target outcome, such as a probability of
    being in the green zone.

A variety of robustness tests were developed to address key
uncertainties identified for jack mackerel, such as recruitment
variability, fleet-specific availability, and stock structure
assumptions (one vs. two stocks). Many of these assumptions relate to
potential impacts from El Niño-like events. These robustness scenarios
were refined during the workshop, and their role was clarified as stress
tests—designed not to predict specific mechanisms, but to evaluate the
relative performance of CMPs under plausible alternative futures.

### Management Procedures Reviewed

Two primary classes of empirical MPs were evaluated:

1.  **Target-based MPs:** TAC is calculated as a function of a fixed
    target catch multiplied by an index-driven adjustment factor.\
2.  **Incremental MPs:** TAC is adjusted from the previous period based
    on indicator trends, resulting in smoother changes over time.

During tuning (e.g., to achieve P(Green) = 0.6), both approaches
frequently led to increased TACs and eventual stock declines—especially
under a high current stock status. This points to the need for
additional metrics that reflect long-term sustainability, not just
near-term status probabilities.

### Technical Recommendations

Some actionable recommendations were articulated:

-   **Indicator Visualization:** Add plots showing the time series of
    indicators used to drive each HCR.\
-   **Projection-End Metrics:** Include statistics that summarize stock
    status and trends at the end of the projection period. This could
    include P(Green) in the final year or a new trend-based metric.\
-   **Weight-at-Age Specification:** Enable projections to use mean
    weights-at-age over a recent period (as done for selectivity),
    rather than fixing weights from the start year.\
-   **Consistency of Reference Points:** Ensure that FMSY and SSBMSY
    reference points used for performance metrics are consistent with
    the selectivity, weights-at-age, and fleet composition used in
    projections. This is critical since MPs are tuned relative to these
    reference points.\
-   **Observation Error Realism:** Consider adding robustness scenarios
    with variable selectivity and weight-at-age during projections to
    better represent realistic observation error in indices—particularly
    for commercial CPUE.
