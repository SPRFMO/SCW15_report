1.  **Welcome and Introduction** \
    *Objective*: Set the stage for the focused discussion on Jack
    Mackerel MSE progress and future directions.\
    *Note*: Briefly introduced the MSE as a tool for sustainable
    fisheries management, emphasizing its importance given the
    historical fluctuations in jack mackerel stock and exploitation
    levels.

2.  **Current Status of Jack Mackerel MSE Work** \
    *Objective*: Provide a concise update on progress, including
    advancements in OMs and MP testing.\
    *Note*: MSE development has progressed rapidly. Updates include new
    data inputs, refinements from the SCW14 benchmark, and expanded
    uncertainty axes. MPs are under active testing.

3.  **Review of Candidate MPs and Tuning Results** \
    *Objective*: Discuss MP structure, indicator choices, and
    implications of tuning to achieve target performance criteria.\
    *Note*: Focused on empirical MPs using CPUE and acoustic indices.
    Tuning challenges under high biomass conditions were highlighted.

4.  **Robustness Scenarios and Specification Refinement** \
    *Objective*: Finalize the list of scenarios for robustness testing.\
    *Note*: Scenarios included El Niño-like variability, availability
    shifts, and alternative stock structures. Their role as comparative
    stress tests was reaffirmed.

5.  **Evaluation Metrics and Visualization Tools** \
    *Objective*: Review tools for comparing MP performance.\
    *Note*: Emphasis on visual summaries, including Kobe plots,
    probability tiles, and trade-off diagrams.

6.  **Feedback from External Experts** \
    *Objective*: Integrate external review findings and technical
    suggestions.\
    *Note*: Dr. Parma’s input emphasized realistic assumptions,
    consistent reference points, and long-term performance evaluation.

7.  **Wrap-up and Next Steps** \
    *Objective*: Identify action items and prepare for upcoming
    reporting deadlines.\
    *Note*: Plans were set for refining MPs, running full simulations,
    and summarizing results in a format accessible to decision-makers.
