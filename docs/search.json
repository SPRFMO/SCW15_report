    "text": "Defining Management Procedures using mpCtrl and mseCtrl\nIn the mse package, Management Procedures (MPs) are constructed as modular sequences of functional components that simulate how a fishery would be managed under alternative strategies. These strategies are defined using mpCtrl, which organizes component modules defined via mseCtrl.\nThis modular design allows you to:\n\nSelect estimation methods for stock status (est)\nDefine harvest control rules (hcr, phcr)\nSimulate implementation systems (isys)\nInclude optional technical measures (tm)\n\n\nStructure of mpCtrl\nThe mpCtrl() constructor takes a named list of components. Each component must be an mseCtrl object that defines the function to use (method) and its input parameters (args).\n\n\nShow the code\nctrl &lt;- mpCtrl(list(\n  est = mseCtrl(method = shortcut.sa, args = list(\n    metric = \"depletion\",\n    devs = metdevs,\n    B0 = refpts(om)$SB0\n  )),\n  hcr = mseCtrl(method = buffer.hcr, args = list(\n    target  = 1000,\n    bufflow = 0.30,\n    buffupp = 0.50,\n    lim     = 0.10,\n    min     = 0,\n    metric  = \"depletion\"\n  )),\n  isys = mseCtrl(method = split.is, args = list(\n    split = catch_props(om)$last5\n  ))\n))\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nest\nThe estimator module determines how the stock status is assessed during each management cycle.\n\n\nhcr\nThe harvest control rule uses the estimated status to recommend a total allowable catch or effort level.\n\n\nphcr\n(Optional) Parametrization helper for complex or adaptive control rules.\n\n\nisys\nSimulates how the recommended catch is implemented across fleets, often using historical proportions or allocation logic.\n\n\ntm\n(Optional) Includes non-catch-based rules, such as minimum size limits or gear restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon method and args Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nExample method\nCommon args\n\n\n\n\nest\nperfect.sa, shortcut.sa\nmetric, devs, B0, years\n\n\nhcr\nbuffer.hcr, hockeystick.hcr, trend.hcr\ntarget, lim, bufflow, buffupp, trigger, metric\n\n\nisys\nsplit.is, fixed.is\nsplit, noise, bias\n\n\ntm\nuser-defined\nsize or spatial constraints\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Building an mseCtrl for a Harvest Control Rule\nEach mseCtrl specifies a method function and its arguments.\n\n\nShow the code\nctl &lt;- mseCtrl(\n  method = buffer.hcr,\n  args = list(\n    target  = 1000,\n    bufflow = 0.30,\n    buffupp = 0.50,\n    lim     = 0.10,\n    min     = 0,\n    metric  = \"depletion\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\nAccessor Functions\nYou can programmatically access or modify components of an mpCtrl object:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Access or change the HCR method\nmethod(ctrl@hcr)\n\n# Update the target biomass value\nargs(ctrl@hcr)$target &lt;- 1200\n\n\nAlternatively, use accessor functions:\n\n\nShow the code\nhcr(ctrl) &lt;- mseCtrl(method = new.hcr, args = list(...))\nargs(ctrl, \"hcr\")$target &lt;- 1100\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis framework enables:\n\nRapid prototyping of management strategies\nTransparent comparisons across MPs\nFlexible integration with simulated operating models\n\nBy separating each component of an MP into a function-object pair, the mse package supports reproducible, configurable, and extensible MSE design workflows.\nTo analyze the behavior of bufferdelta.hcr() over the range of index values used as input (i.e., the stock status metric like ‚Äúdepletion‚Äù or ‚Äúzscore‚Äù), the key output to examine is the harvest control multiplier hcrm‚Äîwhich determines how much the TAC is adjusted relative to the previous TAC. This multiplier is a piecewise function of the index value at the data year.\n\n\nHarvest Control Rule (HCR) with Buffer Delta\nThis HCR formulation uses a smoothed transition based on a buffer zone around a biomass or metric target. The response scalar \\(h(m)\\), applied to the previous catch, is defined based on the relative metric value \\(m\\) (e.g., standardized index or depletion level), and follows a piecewise logic:\nLet:\n\n\\(m\\): observed metric (e.g., index value)\n\\(t\\): target level\n\\(w\\): buffer width\n\\(l = t - 2w\\): limit threshold\n\\(b_{\\text{low}} = t - w\\): buffer lower bound\n\\(b_{\\text{upp}} = t + w\\): buffer upper bound\n\\(r\\): slope ratio\n\nThen the Harvest Control Rule (HCR) response multiplier \\(h(m)\\) is:\n\\[\nh(m) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{m}{l}\\right)^2, & \\text{if } m \\leq l \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{m - l}{b_{\\text{low}} - l} \\right), & \\text{if } l &lt; m &lt; b_{\\text{low}} \\\\\n1, & \\text{if } b_{\\text{low}} \\leq m &lt; b_{\\text{upp}} \\\\\n1 + r \\cdot \\frac{1}{2(b_{\\text{low}} - l)} (m - b_{\\text{upp}}), & \\text{if } m \\geq b_{\\text{upp}} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe resulting Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{TAC}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{TAC}_{\\text{previous}} \\cdot h(m)\n\\]\nOptional constraints on TAC changes can be applied:\n\\[\n\\text{TAC}_{\\text{new}} = \\min(\\text{TAC}_{\\text{new}}, \\text{TAC}_{\\text{previous}} \\cdot d_{\\text{upp}})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{TAC}_{\\text{new}} = \\max(\\text{TAC}_{\\text{new}}, \\text{TAC}_{\\text{previous}} \\cdot d_{\\text{low}})\n\\]\n\n\nüîÅ Behavior Summary\nLet‚Äôs denote:\n\\(m\\): index metric (e.g., depletion) at the data year\n\\(\\text{target}\\): central value, e.g., 0.5\n\\(\\text{width}\\): buffer width, e.g., 1.0\nThen:\n\\(\\text{bufflow} = \\text{target} - \\text{width}\\)\n\\(\\text{buffupp} = \\text{target} + \\text{width}\\)\n\\(\\text{lim} = \\text{target} - 2 \\cdot \\text{width}\\)\n\nüß≠ HCR behavior across index values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex value \\(m\\)\nDescription\nMultiplier h(m)\nTAC behavior\n\n\n\n\n\\(m \\leq \\text{lim}\\)\nVery low index\nQuadratic increase from 0 ‚Üí 0.5\nStrong reduction\n\n\n\\(\\text{lim} &lt; m &lt; \\text{bufflow}\\)\nBetween limit and lower buffer\nLinear rise from 0.5 to 1\nModerate reduction\n\n\n\\(\\text{bufflow} \\leq m &lt; \\text{buffupp}\\)\nWithin buffer zone\nFlat at 1\nNo change\n\n\n\\(m \\geq \\text{buffupp}\\)\nAbove upper buffer\nLinear increase starting at 1 (slope = sloperatio)\nModerate increase\n\n\n\n\n\nüîé Example with Default Parameters\nIf you use the defaults:\ntarget = 0.5\nwidth = 1\nsloperatio = 0.2\nThen:\n‚Ä¢   bufflow = -0.5, buffupp = 1.5, lim = -1.5\n\n‚Ä¢   The flat zone is from -0.5 to 1.5 (note: with depletion metric, this wide range makes sense for standardized metrics like z-scores, but not raw depletion)\nIf using depletion as the metric, you‚Äôd typically want:\ntarget = 0.4\nwidth = 0.1\nsloperatio = 0.2\n‚Üí lim = 0.2, bufflow = 0.3, buffupp = 0.5 So the response curve looks like:\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_hcrm &lt;- function(target = 0.4, width = 0.1, sloperatio = 0.2, metric_range = seq(0, 1, 0.01)) {\n  bufflow &lt;- target - width\n  buffupp &lt;- target + width\n  lim &lt;- target - 2 * width\n\n  hcrm &lt;- ifelse(metric_range &lt;= lim,\n    ((metric_range / lim)^2) / 2,\n    ifelse(metric_range &lt; bufflow,\n      0.5 * (1 + (metric_range - lim) / (bufflow - lim)),\n      ifelse(metric_range &lt; buffupp,\n        1,\n        1 + sloperatio * 1 / (2 * (bufflow - lim)) * (metric_range - buffupp)\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n  plot(metric_range, hcrm,\n    type = \"l\", col = \"blue\", lwd = 2,\n    xlab = \"Metric (e.g., depletion)\", ylab = \"Harvest multiplier (hcrm)\",\n    main = \"Response of TAC to Index Metric\"\n  )\n  abline(h = 1, col = \"gray\", lty = 2)\n  abline(v = c(lim, bufflow, buffupp), col = \"red\", lty = 3)\n}\nplot_hcrm(target = 0.4, width = 0.1, sloperatio = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the piecewise nature of the multiplier and can be tailored to any input metric (depletion, zscore, etc.).",

Effects of El Ni√±o and Distribution Shifts\n\nJim presented an analysis of catch distribution changes between coastal and offshore fleets, proposing a 15% average offshore drop (60% decline in Q for offshore fleet) and an 11% increase for coastal zones.\nParticipants debated the appropriateness of using long-term versus short-term averages and the need for smoothing changes rather than step changes.\nIt was agreed that the effect should be applied to both availability and catchability in simulations, with implications for the acoustic survey indices.\n\n\n\nb. Selectivity and Projection Periods\n\nThe group discussed the transition from recent selectivity estimates to long-term means, with concerns about artifacts from using 10-year averages.\nConsensus moved toward using a representative period (2000‚Äì2010) for selectivity, avoiding recent years with anomalously high selection for older fish.\nThe need for a smooth transition in selectivity assumptions for projections was emphasized.\n\n\n\nc.¬†Recruitment Regimes and Projections\n\nAnalysis of recruitment means for projections considered the El Ni√±o effect, with a proposed 23‚Äì30% bump up in recruitment for recent years.\nDebate ensued on which years to include for calculating means, with a focus on data consistency from 1991 onward.\nThe group discussed the potential for regime shifts and the implications for robustness testing in MSE.\n\n\n\nd.¬†Model Implementation and Coding Practices\n\nDemonstrations were given on the use of R and package structures for running MSE simulations, including best practices for project setup and function sourcing.\nThe importance of consistent selectivity and Q parameter normalization across projections and indices was highlighted.\n\n\n\n\nDecisions and Action Items\n\nAdopt 2000‚Äì2010 as the reference period for selectivity in projections, with a smooth transition from current conditions.\nApply a 23‚Äì30% recruitment increase for projections reflecting recent El Ni√±o effects, with final years to be confirmed.\nEnsure normalization of selectivity and Q parameters is consistent across all indices and projections.\nContinue refining the codebase, documenting changes, and sharing updates among the technical team.\n\n\n\nOther Business and Closing\n\nParticipants shared experiences with data handling, model setup, and coding challenges.\nThe workshop included informal discussions and technical clarifications.\nThe session concluded with plans to continue reviewing model outputs and performance indicators, and to reconvene as needed for further technical work.",

We note that the\n\nCoastal effective catchability increased from a low of 74% (2006‚Äì2010) to a high of 94% (2018‚Äì2024), a +20 percentage point change.\nOffshore effective catchability declined from 26% to 6%.\n\nAs a sensitivity, we could propose that the effective availability to the offshore fleet drops from 15% of the biomass (the mean) to gradually to 6% during El Ni√±o periods (a 60% decline in \\(q\\) ). This would apply to the data generated for offshore CPUE index in the simulations. For the coastal zones, the effect of El Ni√±o would correspond to an 11% increase in the availability of fish relative to the mean (85%). These changes would apply to the Chilean SC CPUE index and the Peruvian CPUE index data generation. This is one proposal among many that could be imagined. For example a slightly more conservative range could be based on the 10th and 90th percentiles of estimated effective catchability (from proportional catches):\nCoastal:\n‚Ä¢   10th percentile: 77%\n‚Ä¢   90th percentile: 94%\nOffshore:\n‚Ä¢   10th percentile: 6%\n‚Ä¢   90th percentile: 23%\nThese shifts may provide some scope for showing the impact of changes in the relative abundance indicators in index values. These reflect patterns over the past two decades, possibly due to environmental changes.",

Their comments provide both a validation of the current approach and targeted suggestions for improvement.\n\nGeneral Observations on the jmMSE Tool\nThe jmMSE package offers a comprehensive and flexible platform for conducting Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). It includes:\n\nA reference set of Operating Models conditioned to historical data using MCMC.\n\nA suite of visualization tools and performance metrics for comparing CMPs.\n\nAn efficient tuning algorithm that adjusts user-selected MP parameters to achieve a target outcome, such as a probability of being in the green zone.\n\nA variety of robustness tests were developed to address key uncertainties identified for jack mackerel, such as recruitment variability, fleet-specific availability, and stock structure assumptions (one vs.¬†two stocks). Many of these assumptions relate to potential impacts from El Ni√±o-like events. These robustness scenarios were refined during the workshop, and their role was clarified as stress tests‚Äîdesigned not to predict specific mechanisms, but to evaluate the relative performance of CMPs under plausible alternative futures.\n\n\nManagement Procedures Reviewed\nTwo primary classes of empirical MPs were evaluated:\n\nTarget-based MPs: TAC is calculated as a function of a fixed target catch multiplied by an index-driven adjustment factor.\n\nIncremental MPs: TAC is adjusted from the previous period based on indicator trends, resulting in smoother changes over time.\n\nDuring tuning (e.g., to achieve P(Green) = 0.6), both approaches frequently led to increased TACs and eventual stock declines‚Äîespecially under a high current stock status. This points to the need for additional metrics that reflect long-term sustainability, not just near-term status probabilities.\n\n\nTechnical Recommendations\nSome actionable recommendations were articulated:\n\nIndicator Visualization: Add plots showing the time series of indicators used to drive each HCR.\n\nProjection-End Metrics: Include statistics that summarize stock status and trends at the end of the projection period. This could include P(Green) in the final year or a new trend-based metric.\n\nWeight-at-Age Specification: Enable projections to use mean weights-at-age over a recent period (as done for selectivity), rather than fixing weights from the start year.\n\nConsistency of Reference Points: Ensure that FMSY and SSBMSY reference points used for performance metrics are consistent with the selectivity, weights-at-age, and fleet composition used in projections. This is critical since MPs are tuned relative to these reference points.\n\nObservation Error Realism: Consider adding robustness scenarios with variable selectivity and weight-at-age during projections to better represent realistic observation error in indices‚Äîparticularly for commercial CPUE.",
