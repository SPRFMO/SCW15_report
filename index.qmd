# Executive summary

The Jack Mackerel Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) Technical
Workshop brought together scientists, technical experts, and external
reviewers to review recent progress and refine the MSE framework being
developed under SPRFMO. The primary goal of the workshop was to ensure
that the modeling framework and management procedures (MPs) are
scientifically sound, technically transparent, and aligned with
management priorities.

### Key Outcomes and Advancements

1.  **MSE Framework Consolidation**\
    Participants reviewed the jmMSE software package, confirming that it
    provides a robust and flexible platform for conducting MSEs. The
    package includes a reference set of operating models conditioned to
    historical data using MCMC, an efficient MP tuning algorithm, and
    tools for visualizing and comparing results.

2.  **Robustness Testing**\
    The workshop clarified the role and scope of robustness tests. These
    tests are intended to explore how CMPs perform under a range of
    plausible yet uncertain scenarios rather than represent definitive
    alternative models. Scenarios reflecting changes in recruitment,
    spatial availability, environmental regime shifts (e.g., El Niño),
    and stock structure were reviewed and refined for implementation.

3.  **Indicator-Driven MPs and HCR logic**\
    Empirical MPs based on one or more indicators were evaluated, with
    focus on two formulations:

    -   TAC as a product of a target and a multiplier from an index.
    -   TAC adjusted incrementally from the previous year based on index
        signals.

    We noted that the high current stock status (well within the “green”
    zone) tended to increase catch levels when tuning to achieve a
    desired P(Green). This can result in declining stock trends later in
    the projection period, even when the short-term performance criteria
    are met.

4.  **Recommendations and Refinements**\
    The group recommended additional diagnostics and refinements,
    including:

    -   Adding plots of how index trajectories relate to TACs.
    -   Including new performance metrics that reflect stock status and
        trends in the final projection years.
    -   Ensuring consistent treatment of selectivity, weights-at-age,
        and catch splits in both projections and reference point
        calculations.
    -   Exploring robustness scenarios that account for variability in
        fleet selectivity and biological assumptions, particularly where
        CPUE is used as an input.

5.  **Documentation and Transparency**\
    The group emphasized the importance of transparency in documenting
    model assumptions, data sources, and MP structure. The group agreed
    on priorities for improving documentation and sharing annotated
    examples of MP behavior.

6.  **Next Steps and Implementation**\
    The next phase of work will focus on finalizing the candidate MPs,
    running the robustness tests, and summarizing trade-offs across key
    performance indicators. In discussions we also identified future
    reporting needs, including summary tables and figures for managers,
    and exploration of reference points and evaluation criteria beyond
    the green zone probability.

# Introduction

Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) has emerged as a critical tool for fisheries
management, especially in contexts where data are limited or uncertainty 
is high. Foundational software frameworks like FLR were developed to 
facilitate reproducible, cross-disciplinary evaluation of management strategies 
through simulation and decision analysis [@Kell2007FLR]. Building on this 
foundation, recent advances have expanded FLR’s capacity for data-rich and 
data-limited systems alike, improving accessibility and integration with 
other tools [@Hillary2023FLR]. Complementing these developments, a structured 
framework for evaluating methods and risk in data-limited fisheries has been 
proposed, providing practical guidance on the application of MSE in real-world 
settings [@Carruthers2023].

The SCW15 Jack Mackerel MSE Technical Workshop was convened in response
to the Scientific Committee’s request for progress on developing and
evaluating management procedures (MPs) for jack mackerel under the
SPRFMO framework. The meeting was held over five days (14–18 July 2025)
and hosted in a hybrid format, with active participation from in-person
attendees in Seattle and remote collaborators from SPRFMO Member States
and invited experts. This event followed on previous technical work,
including the SCW14 benchmark, and focused on finalizing the reference
set of operating models (OMs), implementing robustness tests, and
refining MP candidates using the jmMSE software package.

Throughout the week, participants engaged in live coding sessions,
software validation, model tuning, and scenario refinement. The agenda
was intentionally flexible, allowing the group to respond dynamically to
technical challenges—such as issues with index generation, selectivity
artifacts, and catch variability under different MP formulations. The
workshop emphasized transparency, reproducibility, and documentation,
with clear objectives to improve the utility and credibility of the MSE
outputs ahead of Scientific Committee and Commission review.

By way of review, we provide a general outline for the workflow for
defining and evaluating Management Procedures (MPs). We divided the
process into three main stages (@fig-mp_flow).

![Workflow for evaluating and selecting candidate management procedures
(MPs).](images/mp_flow.png){#fig-mp_flow fig-align="center"}

The workshop participants recognized that all of the pieces for this
exercise were available and implemented. However, the group struggled
with getting the candidate MPs defined relative to available indices
("stage 1" in the diagram).

The appendices provide the 
[participants](doc/App_A.qmd)
[participants](#app-participants), 
the [agenda](doc/App_B.qmd) and the daily summary activities in the workshop
[minutes](doc/App_C.qmd). The review from the external experts is
also summarized in an [appendix](doc/App_D.qmd) as well.

The following sections detail the discussion on how best to incorporate
some environmental effects for projecting from the operating model.
Specifically, we considered how to account for the effects of El Niño on
recruitment and catchability/availability.
We follow this with a sections reviewing the OM and then some results from 
applying existing and refined MPs. We conclude with a set of recommendations for 
the SC to consider.

# Simulating El Niño effects in the Operating Model

To incorporate climate-driven variability into the Operating Model (OM)
projections, we defined a scenario simulating El Niño–like events every five years
beginning in 2030. These events affect primarily recruitment and
distribution options. Based on the work of Iago and available literature, we
proposed biological and fishery
processes that may relate to El Niño conditions. The group discussed these and noted
that they could be evaluated in the next round of stock assessment
benchmark and for future MSE work.

The table below summarizes the proposed effects of simulated El Niño
conditions on the OM, categorizing them by their
expected direction, biological or fishery-based justification, and
evaluation priority. The table is divided into two sections: effects
that are prioritized for immediate evaluation and those deferred for
further study.

The first items highlights two key El Niño-driven effects: A 30%
increase in recruitment with a one-year lag, linked to ENSO-related
early life stage survival (@fig-enso-recruitment). Shifts in
catchability, with coastal regions experiencing increased availability
and offshore regions seeing declines, reflecting observed onshore
movement of fish during warm anomalies. This is also high-priority, with
a focus on quantifying impacts on fishery removals.

The deferred effects were discussed and included the potential for
reduced weight-at-age (potentially due to prey scarcity), earlier
maturity (a stress response observed in small pelagics), and increased
natural mortality (from predation or environmental stress). These are
flagged for future study, pending historical data checks or further
evidence. The table succinctly organizes hypotheses while clarifying
immediate next steps for the OM framework.

![Recruitment estimates and mean values (horizontal lines) used to
estimate the impact of ENSO
effects.](images/ENSO_R.png){#fig-enso-recruitment fig-align="center"}

The following tables summarizes the key effects, their expected
directions, and justification.

| Effect | Direction | Justification |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Recruitment ↑20% | ↑ 1-year lag | ENSO-linked early life stage effects on recruitment |
| Regional availability | Coast catchability ↑ and offshore ↓ | Onshore shift during warm anomalies |

| Effect | Direction | Justification | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Weight-at-age | ↓Productivity | Lower prey density and observed condition declines | Check historical WAA anomalies |
| Age-1 maturity | Earlier maturity | Stress response seen in small pelagics | similar impact on Recruitment |
| Coastal selectivity | Age 1–2 sel ↑ | Spatial contraction, availability change | Confirm from CPUE by age? |
| M ↑30%/20% | ↓ Survival | Stress-induced mortality, predation |  |

## Estimating Relative Availability from Catch Proportions

Taking an assumption that over a recent period that changes in a
smoothed proportion of catch by coastal and offshore areas roughly
relates to the effective catchability $q$ (which includes both true
catchability and availability) of the fishery, i.e.:

$$
\text{Catch}_{\text{fleet}} \propto q_{\text{fleet}} 
$$

Thus, observed catch proportions can serve as a proxy for relative
availability.

| Year Range | Coastal (%) | Offshore (%) |
|-----------:|------------:|-------------:|
|  2004–2008 |          81 |           19 |
|  2005–2009 |          78 |           22 |
|  2006–2010 |          74 |           26 |
|  2007–2011 |          76 |           24 |
|  2008–2012 |          78 |           22 |
|  2009–2013 |          82 |           18 |
|  2010–2014 |          84 |           16 |
|  2011–2015 |          86 |           14 |
|  2012–2016 |          86 |           14 |
|  2013–2017 |          85 |           15 |
|  2014–2018 |          86 |           14 |
|  2015–2019 |          87 |           13 |
|  2016–2020 |          91 |            9 |
|  2017–2021 |          93 |            7 |
|  2018–2022 |          94 |            6 |
|  2019–2023 |          94 |            6 |
|  2020–2024 |          94 |            6 |
|   **Mean** |      **85** |       **15** |

: **5-year moving averages of the proportion of the catch occurring in
the "coastal" areas compared to the offshore fleet.**

### Range of Change in Estimated Availability

Given this pattern we can assume a relative catchability due to an
environmental effect. We note that the

-   **Coastal effective catchability** increased from a low of **74%**
    (2006–2010) to a high of **94%** (2018–2024), a **+20 percentage
    point** change.
-   **Offshore effective catchability** declined from **26%** to **6%**.

As a sensitivity, we could propose that the effective availability to
the offshore fleet drops from 15% of the biomass (the mean) to gradually
to 6% during El Niño periods (a 60% decline in $q$ ). This would apply
to the data generated for offshore CPUE index in the simulations. For
the coastal zones, the effect of El Niño would correspond to an 11%
increase in the availability of fish relative to the mean (85%). These
changes would apply to the Chilean SC CPUE index and the Peruvian CPUE
index data generation. This is one proposal among many that could be
imagined. For example a slightly more conservative range could be based
on the 10th and 90th percentiles of estimated effective catchability
(from proportional catches):

```         
Coastal:
•   10th percentile: 77%
•   90th percentile: 94%
Offshore:
•   10th percentile: 6%
•   90th percentile: 23%
```

These shifts may provide some scope for showing the impact of changes in
the relative abundance indicators in index values. These reflect
patterns over the past two decades, possibly due to environmental
changes.

# Review of the Operating Model specifications

The workshop reviewed the current specifications of the 
OMs. In particular, the assumptions for the reference point
calculations were discusssed and contrasted with the 2024 assessment
results and reports (@sprfmo2024annex7). Due to the terminal (2024)
estimates of fisheries selectivities, the assessment report had
anomalously high values for $F_{MSY}$

While the 2024 stock assessment produced high estimates of potential
catch under the third tier of the harvest control rule—exceeding 4,900
kt based on $F_{MSY}$—this result was considered unrealistic due to
likely upward bias in $F_{{MSY}}$ estimates caused by strong selection
on older fish. As a result, the Scientific Committee recommended
constraining the 2025 TAC to be at or below 1,428 kt, representing only
a 15% increase from 2024 levels and aligned with the Commission’s
guidance. In developing the OM, reference points such
as $F_{{MSY}}$ were instead based on longer-term averages to avoid the
influence of short-term variability or cohort effects, ensuring more
stable and precautionary management advice consistent with the MSE
framework (@fig-ref_pts).

![Distribution of reference points from the operating model accepted by the workshop.](images/ref_pts.png){#fig-ref_pts}

Several issues were identified with the current stock assessment that
warrant further attention ahead of the next benchmark. Key among them
are uncertainties in catch-at-age data stemming from differences in age
determination methods across laboratories, as well as assumptions about
mean body weight at age. The Scientific Committee emphasized the need
for standardizing CPUE indices and improving data collection protocols,
particularly regarding fleet-specific efficiency changes. Sensitivities
to early age composition data—especially from the pre-1990 period—remain
unresolved, with residual patterns noted for the North Chilean fleet. In
addition, assumptions underlying selectivity and recruitment regimes
were highlighted as critical sources of uncertainty, with substantial
influence on reference points and management advice. Finally, the
Committee underscored the importance of continued evaluation of
single-stock versus two-stock model structures using simulation and MSE
tools.

# Summary of Workshop Outcomes

The SCW15 workshop provided a venue for progressing the Jack Mackerel
MSE work, resolving some technical issues, and evaluating multiple MP
configurations. A key outcome was the identification of problems in how
MPs interacted with the OMs. This raised the need for either resolution
of MP specification issues prior to the SC and/or holding a separate
follow-up technical meeting, ideally in person. This would focus
discussion on narrowing MP options. Depending on this direction, it may
mean that such a meeting would have to occur after February 2026 and the
Commission meeting. 

Regarding the ability and facility for member scientists to use and evaluate
the MSE framework, the group noted that the development of the jmMSE package 
was exceptionally  well done. We found that difficulties inherent to the jack
mackerel resource and assessment created unique problems. Specifically, the 
variable resource distribution, available data, 
and specifications of projection conditions (e.g., mean body mass-at-age, fishery
selectivity at age) complicated how MPs could be evaluated. We noted that such
specifications would be problematic for any other MSE framework as well. 


### Software and Technical Recommendations

-   Continue using **FLR** as the main MSE engine unless there is a
    dedicated effort to migrate to **openMSE** or another platform.

-   Improve naming conventions in code to reduce ambiguity. For example:

    -   Functions like `cpuescore2.ind` and `cpuescore3.ind` could better reflect their
        purpose.


### MSE Development Timeline and Deliverables

The group noted that MSE funding (in the form of providing support from
external developers) may be available but would be contingent on:

-   Coordination with the current analyst (Iago).

-   Collaboration with the technical team.

-   Openness to using **openMSE**.

-   Clear timelines and deliverables.

Proposed deliverables and deadlines include:

-   **Reference OMs** (no multistock): End of July

-   **Robustness OMs** (no multistock): End of August

-   **Shortcut calibration** to the JJM assessment: End of August

-   **Range of shortcut MPs** run for all reference OMs: End of July

Planned products:

-   Technical documentation and reports:

    -   Draft Technical Summary Document (TSD) by end of July.

    -   Technical working papers and presentations for:

        -   Shortcut calibration to JJM

        -   Reference set OM results for MP archetypes

        -   Robustness OM results

        -   MP performance summaries

    -   Slick MSE results summary.

    -   TSD v1 by end of September.

### Recommendations

#### For SC:

-   Adopt the current proposal structure with flexibility for future
    adjustment.

-   Recommend a shortlist of MP options to simplify the selection
    process at the Commission level.

-   Consider a placeholder method for calculating the 2026 TAC if MSE
    work is not yet finalized.

#### For Members:

-   Commit to a shared MSE software base (FLR or openMSE).

-   Engage in pre-SC online meetings to broaden participation in MSE
    discussions.

#### For Analyst (Iago):

-   Prioritize enhancements discussed during the workshop:

    -   Code clarity and naming conventions

    -   Logical parameter usage across MPs

    -   Refinement of FLR-to-dataframe functions

-   Identify successor strategy after contract ends in 2025.

# Jack mackerel MSE workplan

During the 2025 Commission meeting (COMM13), Chile proposed a deviation from the established Management Procedure (MP) guidance by recommending a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for *Trachurus murphyi* of 1.785 million tonnes for 2025[^1]. This proposal exceeded the 15% year-on-year TAC change limit adopted by the Commission as part of its management framework[^2]. Chile based its proposal on Article 4.3 of the Convention, asserting the need to consider measures by coastal states and highlighting that the stock had remained above MSY reference levels for over five consecutive years[^3].

Chile also cited Scientific Committee (SC) analysis, particularly paragraph 136 of the SC12 Report, which indicated that the stock was in Tier 3 of the adopted Harvest Control Rule (HCR), theoretically allowing for a much higher TAC (up to 4.997 Mt) if the full HCR were applied[^4]. However, as per the Commission's directive to the SC (COMM3-Annex C), catch advice was constrained to not exceed a 15% increase, consistent with the MP in place[^2].

The Scientific Committee Chair emphasized in plenary that the SC's advice adhered to the current MP, limiting TAC changes to ±15% to account for uncertainties, including potential model misspecification. Paragraphs 136 and 137 of the SC12 report note that this constraint was not intended to account for rebuilding potential, but rather to ensure precautionary stability and reduce the risk of large interannual TAC fluctuations[^5].

Chile revised its proposal multiple times (COMM13-Prop01_rev1 through rev5) to address Member concerns, including scientific justification, process adherence, and future management stability. Nevertheless, many Members expressed concern that implementing a TAC increase beyond 15% ahead of finalizing the MSE would undermine the credibility of the HCR framework and create challenges for future rule-based decisions.

Chile also referred to Table 37 of Annex 7 of the SC12 report, which showed that biomass remained above target levels under various fishing scenarios. However, the SC Chair cautioned that these projections were illustrative only and not intended for management advice[^6]. The SC further stressed that alternative scenarios outside the adopted HCR should be evaluated through MSE before informing decisions.

Following intensive discussions and compromises, the Commission adopted a revised proposal (COMM13-Prop01_rev5), establishing a one-year TAC of 1.785 Mt for 2025 while reaffirming:

- The importance of completing the MSE and adopting a revised MP and HCR by 2026;
- The temporary nature of the 2025 deviation;
- The application of Article 20(5) of the Convention to enable responsive management should the stock decline[^7].

<!-- `(1,419,119-1,135,297)/1,135,297 = 25%` -->

<!-- We note that the  *Trachurus murphyi* undertaken by vessels flagged to Members and Cooperating Non-Contracting Parties (CNCPs) included on the Commission Record of Vessels (CMM 05-2023) in the Convention Area and, in accordance with Article 20(4)(a)(iii) and with the express consent of Chile and Ecuador, to fisheries for *Trachurus murphyi* undertaken by Chile and Ecuador in areas under their national jurisdiction. -->

This episode highlighted both the limitations of static MP rules under changing stock and socioeconomic conditions, and the importance of timely completion of the MSE process to provide more flexible and scientifically robust guidance.

## Near term

Participants were encouraged to document their activities during the
workshop, including the methods explored and tuning targets used. Work
tasked identified included:

-   **All** continue to evaluate MPs to the extent practical ensuring that
    they can be tuned to achieve a 60% green status and are consistent with the available
    OM data stream projections.
    
-   **Jim** evaluated 9 MPs (including `bufferdelta2`, `cpuescore2`,
    test acoustic, and combinations of CPUE indices with different
    `delta_TAC` values), all tuned to achieve 60% green status.

-   **Jose/Chile** apply shortcut tuning methods to reach similar green
    zone targets.
    

This table illustrates how an array of MPs might be evaluated for summarization:

| Year | Method | Metric | Tuning Parameter | Other Parameters | Score Index | Comments |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024+ | `buffer.hcr` | depletion | target | bufflow, buffup, limit | `cpuescore3.ind` | Original pkg function |
| 2024+ | `bufferdelta.hcr` | depletion | width | sloperatio | `cpuescore3.ind` | Modified; not compatible with z-score metrics |
| 2024+ | `bufferdelta2.hcr` | zscore | width | sloperatio | `cpuescore2.ind` | New; not compatible with depletion |
| 2024+ | `buffer2.hcr` | zscore | target | width (affects buffer) | `cpuescore2.ind` | Original; adjusted for zscore (limit = -2 SD) |
    
## Medium term

The group agreed to continue working on the MSE framework, with a focus
on the following tasks:
  -   **Consider how reference set of OMs could be regenerated** conditioned to historical data using MCMC methods.
  -   **Implement robustness tests** to evaluate how MPs perform under a range of plausible yet uncertain scenarios.
  -   **Refine MP candidates** using the jmMSE software package, ensuring they are scientifically sound and technically transparent.
  -   **Document and share** the MSE framework, including model assumptions, data sources, and MP structure.
  -   **Explore additional diagnostics** and refinements, including new performance metrics that reflect stock status and trends in the final projection years.
